# Page Snapshot ZIP

**v1.0.0.** A self-contained Firefox/Tampermonkey userscript. Open any HTTP(S) page, then choose **Tampermonkey → Page Snapshot ZIP → Download current page snapshot (ZIP)**. It does absolutely nothing until you select this command.

The locally downloaded ZIP contains:

- `index.html` — best-effort **non-executable** offline rendering. Scripts are removed and a restrictive CSP is inserted.
- `source-dom.html` — original currently rendered page DOM, including inline JavaScript, styles and resource URLs. **Do not open it as an executable HTML document on an untrusted computer.**
- `assets/` — retrieved client-side JS, CSS, images, fonts, media, WASM, accessible maps and discovered dependencies, as available.
- `manifest.json` — original URL for every captured asset, bytes and MIME type, failures, and exactly which limits were reached.
- `README.txt` — archive guide.

The collector examines current DOM resource references, inline CSS, accessible stylesheets and the recent Performance Resource Timeline. It resolves CSS URLs/imports and static JS module/worker references up to a bounded depth. The ZIP uses the standard uncompressed **STORE** method; it is a real ZIP container, but assets are not additionally compressed.

## Permissions and privacy

This is **an explicitly reviewed exception** to the normal narrow-host rule. `@match http://*/*` and `@match https://*/*` make the command available on arbitrary websites. `@connect *` permits requesting resources from cross-origin CDNs, including redirected hosts; Tampermonkey can ask you to approve additional hosts. There are **no background requests, no automatic uploads, no remote code libraries, no cookie/storage export**, and no automatic version updates. All fetching starts only after a direct menu click; downloads go to your own computer.

The resulting archive can contain private text, authenticated assets and token-bearing URLs. **Do not publish it without examining its contents first.**

## Safety budgets

Maximum **600 assets**, **24 MiB per resource**, **192 MiB total assets**, **16 seconds per request**, **two simultaneous asset requests**, and **three levels of discovered dependencies**. The DOM source has a 12-million-character cap. A visible progress panel provides **Cancel**, which aborts active requests and prevents saving the archive. Resources that cannot be fetched or exceed limits appear in `manifest.json`.

No automatic browser tab traversal or extension injection is performed. No whole-browser cache or network interception is used. Snapshots may be incomplete and the script reports what it missed.

## What cannot be recovered

A userscript does not have access to server-side application source code, protected internal browser caches, the full network history and POST response bodies, every cross-origin iframe, closed shadow roots, canvas/WebGL buffers, decrypted DRM media, or assets blocked by permissions/CSP. Dynamic SPAs frequently depend on backend APIs and will not become a fully functional offline copy. `index.html` intentionally disables scripts to prevent replaying live actions.

The real Firefox profile is not touched by repository QA. Release suitability depends on isolated browser testing and your own specific page.
